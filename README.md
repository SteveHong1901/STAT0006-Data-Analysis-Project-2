# STAT0006-Regression Modelling-Project-2

## Title Coursework: Ice Cream Sales Prediction Model

This project is a key academic component for the STAT0006 module at University College London (UCL), focusing on constructing an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model. The primary objective is to predict ice cream sales using a specified set of variables.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Conduct comprehensive data examination to identify patterns, anomalies, and inter-variable relationships.

- **Feature Selection**: 
  - Execute a strategic selection process for the most impactful variables influencing ice cream sales predictions.

- **Assumption Evaluation**: 
  - Perform rigorous assessments of OLS model assumptions to ensure validity and reliability in the dataset's context.

- **Model Limitations and Insights**: 
  - Provide detailed analysis on the constraints of the current model, along with suggestions for enhancements and areas for future research.

This coursework exemplifies a meticulous application of statistical methodologies, underpinned by critical evaluation, aiming to derive meaningful conclusions from real-world data scenarios.
